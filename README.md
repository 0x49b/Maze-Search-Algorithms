## Folder Organization
- **Algorithms:** Separate implementation of search algorithms.
- **Components:** UI Helpers.
- **Libraries:** Project dependencies.
- **Map:** Map Generation and Search.

## Algorithms
For this work, the following *search algorithms* were implemented
- **A*:** Uses both g(n) and heuristics to perform a best-first search.
- **BFS**: Breadth-first search performs a level-by-level search.
- **DFS**: Depth-first search explores as far as possible and then performs *backtracking*.
- **Greedy**: Locally optimal choice according to heuristics.
- **Uniform:** Because the costs are always one, in this program uniform performs identically to BFS.

## Project Dependencies
- **p5.js**:  Client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences. There is no need to install this library as it is already in the *library* folder.
